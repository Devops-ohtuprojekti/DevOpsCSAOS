notes on responsiveness...

- do not try to find "limit points where a laptop becomes a phone" etc.
- breakpoint = a width point where layout of the page should be altered to
keep things looking nice
- industry-standard minimum width to prepare for (from semi-to-non-credible web sources): 320px
- found no reliable standard on min-height, 450-500px seems like a reasonable limit.
height is anyway less of an issue as the app can be scrolled

do things look nice? -data below
how-to: open app, open console, go to Elements-tab
-> when screen size is changed pixel counts are displayed top-right of the screen

WIDTH BREAKPOINTS
first page: < 500px and looks funny
signup: < 1200px and looks funny (top/bottom margins have bad scaling)
survey pages: < 1200px option button paddings get too small (option text too close to button border)
< 1000px line between questions looks too short
< 950px top margin gets too narrow (survey header weirdly close to progress bar)
< 840px option button labels start to spill outside the button
summary page: < 650px left/right outer margins start to look too wide in comparison to summary container
result page: < 1400px square images' shape starts to alter (height remains, width shrinks)
< 1200px left-right inner wrapper padding looks too wide
< 900px category texts look too narrow
< 650px top margin gets too narrow (survey header weirdly close to progress bar)
< 650px left/right outer margins start to look too wide in comparison to summary container

--> breakpoints: [1400, 1200, 1000, 950, 840, 650, 650]
(these will change when bad scaling issues are solved
-> for example when the margins are scaled properly option texts fit in buttons 
with smaller screen widths)
